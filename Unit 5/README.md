# Unit 5: Regular Expressions
This unit is an introduction to regular expressions, which is useful in not only search and replace operations, but even finding errors in code! We even go in depth to regular expressions by learning about the theory behind regular expressions, specifically, with modeling deterministic finite automata (DFA).

## Labs

The labs we covered in this unit, where the code for the labs are located in its respective subdirectory, are:
- Regex Brainteasers (Levels 1 - 3)
- Practical Regex
    - Dictionary Search
    - Python Errors
- Theoretical Regex
    - Modeling Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
