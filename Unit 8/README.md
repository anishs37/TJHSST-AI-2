# Unit 8: Machine Learning
In this unit, we start off with an unsupervised learning algorithm: KMeans, which is designed to look at a lot of data and find meaningful groups/clusters in the data. In this unit, we apply KMeans to two tasks: to analyze text-based data (star clusters) and image data (vectorizing images).

## Labs

The labs we covered in this unit, where the code for the labs are located in the KMeans subdirectory, are:
- Analyzing the Star Dataset (kmeans_6.py)
- Image vectorization (image_vec.py)
- Image vectorization with Floyd-Steinberg dithering (image_vec_dither.py)
