# Artificial Intelligence 2
This repository will contain my code for the Artificial Intelligence 2 labs at TJHSST.

## Units

This course included six main units, namely:
- Unit 5: Regular Expressions
- Unit 6: Genetic Algorithms
- Unit 7: Natural Language Toolkit
- Unit 8: Machine Learning
- Unit 9: Neural Networks
- Unit 10: fast.ai


Here are some of the major labs we completed over the course of the semester:
- [Solving Substitution Ciphers](https://github.com/anishs37/TJHSST-AI-2/blob/main/Unit%206/sub_ciphers.py)
- [Image Vectorization with KMeans++ and Dithering](https://github.com/anishs37/TJHSST-AI-2/blob/main/Unit%208/KMeans/image_vec_dither.py)
- [MNIST Digits Classification with Back Propagation](https://github.com/anishs37/TJHSST-AI-2/tree/main/Unit%209/Back%20Propagation)
