# Unit 6: Genetic Algorithms
In this unit, we covered genetic algorithms, which improve upon the hill climbing algorithm. Specifically, genetic algorithms are based on Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution/selection, where the "fitest" algorithms are selected for reproduction to produce "offspring algorithms" for the next generation.

## Labs
